      The Computer/Geek theme (laptop enemies, bsods) which is visible
      in the current CVS version will be dropped and be replaced with
      something more comical.

      <picture file="images/evil_penguin.png">
        The Evil Penguin should look similar to Tux, it will probally
        have another color and another shaped bill. Ranges of attack
        might be something simple such as spitting balls or eggs at
        Tux. There might even be multiple levels of evil penguins with
        different behaviours (fire, ice).

    <subsection title="Mr. Bomb">
      <picture file="images/mrbomb.png">
        Pretty much every game has some kind of exploding enemy, so
        SuperTux should have something like that too. For the moment
        this should be our Mr. Bomb, a plain and simple Bomb running
        on its tiny feed.

    <subsection title="Mr. IceBlock">
      <picture file="images/mriceblock.png">
        Mr. IceBlock could be the most basic enemy in SuperTux, he
        just walks around without having any 'special attacks' or
        something like that. Jumping on Mr. IceBlock should flatten
        him and thus kill him.
