    This page should catch should act as a collecting place for ideas,
    graphics and other stuff surrounding the SuperTux development.
    None of it should be taken as final, but more as an source of
    inspiration and brainstorming.

  <section title="Actions">
    <subsection title="BlowFlyer">
      <picture file="images/blowflyer.png">
        The BlowFlyer or BaloonTux action should be a temporary
        limited action in which Tux fills his body with air (helium?!)
        and is thus able to fly for a short time, ie as long as he can
        go without breathing. The end of the flight should be
        announced by Tux changing color and catching for air.

    <subsection title="Evil Penguin">
      <picture file="images/evil_penguin.png">
        The Evil Penguin should look similar to Tux, it will probally
        have another color and another shaped bill. Ranges of attack
        might be something simple such as spitting balls or eggs at
        Tux. There might even be multiple levels of evil penguins with
        different behaviours (fire, ice).

    <subsection title="Mr. Bomb">
      <picture file="images/mrbomb.png">
        Pretty much every game has some kind of exploding enemy, so
        SuperTux should have something like that too. For the moment
        this should be our Mr. Bomb, a plain and simple Bomb running
        on its tiny feed.
