    SuperTux will use OpenGL-only in the future, software rendering is
    obsolete and will get removed has soon as feature get introduced
    that are only doable in OpenGL.
  </section>

  <section title="Level Format">
    <p>
      There hasn't been any finial decissions on the level format,
    however what we need is basically something that can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>hold multiple tilemaps per level</li>
      <li>hold scriptable trickers and such</li>
      <li>hold the position of enemies and there state</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section title="Tiles">
    <img src="images/tiletype.png" />

    <p>
      SuperTux should feature 5 basic tile shapes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>empty</li>
      <li>full</li>
      <li>100% slope</li>
      <li>50% slope</li>
      <li>200% slope</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      In addition to them it will feature them in mirrored form and in
      a form that allows two 50% tiles to form a smooth slope. With
      these basic tile shapes it should be possible to form reasonably
      smooth circles and smooth shapes into the terrain.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section title="Tile Types">
    <p>
      Beside normal and opaque tiles, there will be quite a few
      different tile types:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>ice tiles, which make the ground slippery and controlls harder</li>
      <li>slime tiles/water tiles, which make movement slower</li>
      <li>lava/fire tiles, which kill Tux or rob him some energie</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section title="Raising Lava">
    <p>
      To speed up gameplay a bit and to provide a raising danger to
      Tux, some levels might feature raising lava, acid or poising gas
      that will come from below or from the left and will require the
      player to quickly advance to survive.
