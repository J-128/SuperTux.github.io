    <p>
      SuperTux should feature 5 basic tile shapes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>empty</li>
      <li>full</li>
      <li>100% slope</li>
      <li>50% slope</li>
      <li>200% slope</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      In addition to them it will feature them in mirrored form and in
      a form that allows two 50% tiles to form a smooth slope. With
      these basic tile shapes it should be possible to form reasonably
      smooth circles and smooth shapes into the terrain.
