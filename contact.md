## Contact

Here are the many ways you can contact the team. Usually they will answer quite
quickly, but if they don't please be patient and give them the benefit of the
doubt. Yes, that means stick around IRC longer than 2 minutes.

IRC. You can find us on [freenode](https://freenode.net/) (server:
