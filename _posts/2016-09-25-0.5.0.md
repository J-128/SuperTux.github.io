The SuperTux team is excited to announce the availability of the stable release 0.5.0 after less than a year of development. The most prominent change for this release is a new in-game level editor which allows you to create levels and worldmaps on-the-fly from within SuperTux itself. We would like to apologize for publishing the 0.4.0 release with a large number of issues.

In order to improve the Forest Island in the future, please help by filling out the poll at <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8_nxdagVCHV2s7SX517aDTkEQLVXCA6KaufbPHBxyFtuH_Q/viewform>.

If you'd like to help with SuperTux development, you can find more resources in our wiki at <https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki>. Please [get in touch with us](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Contact). The fastest way is usually [IRC](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/IRC), but please wait if you don't get an answer immediately. We urgently need more graphic designers and developers for future releases, help in these areas would be really appreciated.

Changes:

* In-game level editor
* Improved levels in Antarctica and Forest Island
* Language packs are fixed
* Engine performance improvements
* Extended the scripting API: gradients are now scriptable
* Added a few more tiles and music
* New console commands and command line options (related to the editor)
* Various other bugfixes of issues reported since the v0.4.0 release
* And more (minor) improvements and changes

A big thanks to Hume2 and Tobbi, who worked very hard on the new in-game level editor, and also all of our translators who worked very hard to translate the new strings in time.
