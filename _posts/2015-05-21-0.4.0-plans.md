We (The SuperTux Team) have put our heads together, and we are going to try to officially release SuperTux 0.4.0 as a stable version sometime in December. We currently are planning on that month, so right now is a crucial time to have people bug testing. If you would like to help with bug testing you can find the latest downloads in the [Download](download.html) section. As always, if you come across a bug ( or what might be one, feel free to report it in our [Bug Tracker.](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/issues) If you would like to help us get this release out you can find more information on our [contact section.](contact.html)
