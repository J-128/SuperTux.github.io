The SuperTux Team wishes you a happy and successful new year.

Since the release of SuperTux 0.5, we have received a lot of feedback on the
editor, much of which has been very positive. Some of this feedback comes in the
form of  levels, some as feedback on IRC or in the forums. The team would like
to thank you for voicing some of your thoughts and ideas, and encourage you to
keep telling us what you think so that we can continue improving the game.

However, we also noticed several usability problems in the user interface.
We want to ensure the level editor is easy to use for our players, so we wish to
collect more detailed feedback in the form of a survey.

It would help the team out a lot if you could fill in the form
[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7njq9LaKY033bkbru_iMG2RdhTWFtW_6eb9dSjttD6F0iMg/viewform).
