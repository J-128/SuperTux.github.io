This is a bugfix release fixing some smaller problems that were reported after
the release of 0.5.0. It mostly features changes to the behavior of the level
editor, and adds some options that were missing but should have been included in
the stable release 0.5.0.

If you'd like to help with SuperTux development, you can find more resources in our wiki at <https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki>. Please [get in touch with us](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Contact). The fastest way is usually [IRC](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/IRC), but please wait if you don't get an answer immediately. We urgently need more graphic designers and developers for future releases, help in these areas would be really appreciated.

Changes:

* Editor: Tilemap: Add an option to change the draw target
* Editor: Add an option to snap objects to the grid (this will make it easier to
  add objects to a nice location in levels)
* Editor: Camera: Remove autoscroll option, as it is deprecated and should not
  be used anymore
* Editor: Fix an issue where some areas in the editor would be excessively large
  relative to the window/screen size
