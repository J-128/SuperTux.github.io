The homepage is generated from a set of xml pages. You need to have xsltproc
installed to transform the xml files to html (xsltproc is part of the libxslt
package).
You can upload a new homepage like this (myusername should be your lethargik
account name)

    make upload ST_USERNAME=myusername

PS: Please don't forget to do "svn update" before uploading and to "svn ci"
after uploading!
