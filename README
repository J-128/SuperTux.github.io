The homepage is generated from a set of xml pages. You should edit these xml
files and only commit these to cvs! You need to have xsltproc installed to
transform the xml files to html (xsltproc is part of the libxslt package).

You can upload a new homepage like this (myusername should be your berlios
account name)

    make upload ST_USERNAME=myusername
