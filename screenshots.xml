      Some shots from our lastest work (0.0.6), released at March 15, 2004.
      Basically this was a code clean-up version. Features a leveleditor and an OpenGL front-end. Menu as improved a lot, and fonts were also remade.

      A couple of shots from our 0.0.5 release, released at December 29, 2003.
      Graphics were improved a lot. Also this version features a menu, and internal clean-ups have started.

      Wow! These are really ancients shots from versions prior to 0.0.5.
      Graphics were a bit ugly, but it was already playble and had a SuperMario1 feel.
