			<p>
				This is a release for the big SuperTux fans. We were asked to make more
				levels, making some more challenging, so here's our answer. This
				version has a brand new Bonus Island map, new map features, a new enemy
				and some new tiles.

		<subsubsection title="Flexlay">
			<p>
				Flexlay is the editor that was used to build most of the
				levels and the Worldmap in Milestone1. It provides a few
				more features than the build in one (zoom, minimap, worldmap
				support), but requires a few more dependencies and OpenGL on
				the other side.
