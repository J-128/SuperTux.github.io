    <p>
      SuperTux is a classic 2D jump'n run sidescroller game in a
      similar style like the original SuperMario games. The new
      <em>Milestone 1</em> release of SuperTux features 9 enemies, 26
      playable levels, a worldmap that allows you to travel from one
      level to the next, software and OpenGL rendering modes,
      configurable joystick and keyboard input, new music and
      completly redone graphics. Together with a little story we hope
      to provide a reasonablly good gaming experince with this first
      Milestone release for the player.

      The improvments in Milestone1 are in huge part the result of the
      work done surrounding the <a
      href="http://www.happypenguin.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1240">Game
      of the Month March 2004</a> event on <a
      href="http://www.happypenguin.org/">happypenguin.org</a>.

    <p>
      The <a href="milestone1/index.html">Milestone1 section</a> of
      this webpage was mainly used to coordinate development and to
      post sketches and other things. It will give you an overview of
      the development of the features and enemies that have gone in
      Milestone1, it might be a bit outdated and is mainly present for
      historic reasons to those interested in the development.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="development/index.html">Development section</a> on
      the other side gives and unsorted overview about features which
      might get into new releases, its more meant as a sketchpad for
      collecting ideas then as a guideline. So if you have any
      additions to that page, feel free to submit them to the mailing
      list.
