      SuperTux is currently getting an overvault. Thus this webpage is a
      bit chaotic at the moment and will most likly stay that way for
      the next few weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following links should help to keep the overview a bit:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/supertux/">The
          orignial webpage of SuperTux</a>, ie. the one that was used
        before the overvault started</li>

      <li><a href="milestone1/index.html">The Milestone1 webpage</a>,
        ie. the one that contains all the information for the next
        version (the one created for GotM)</li>
      
      <li><a href="development/index.html">The generic Development
          webpage</a>, ie the one that contains information and ideas
        for future development, its mainly only here for
        brainstorming, its not meant to be implemented</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section title="Contact">
    <p>
      Development is mainly coordinated via IRC (#supertux at
      irc.freenode.net) and the <a
      href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/super-tux-devel">SuperTux
      Mailing list</a>, be sure to visit both once in a while or you
      might miss critical stuff.
