    <p>
      Currently there are no people working on music and soundeffects
      for SuperTux, so if you are any good add doing them, feel
      welcome. We need around five songs for SuperTux:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>menu music</li>
      <li>music for the tileset</li>
      <li>music for the cave-tileset</li>
      <li>music for the 'castle' tileset</li>
      <li>additional short music snipes for game-over, end-of-level,
      etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section title="Milestone 1 Soundeffects">
    <p>
      Milestone1 also needs sound effects, something like a few
      'clicks' when moving around in the menu, stuff for game-over,
      for kicking and jumping on enemies and such.
