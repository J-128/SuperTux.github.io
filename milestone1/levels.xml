      This should be a guideline for level designers. You can of
      course do whatever you want in your level design, but it might
      be worth to try to get a consistent look&amp;feel, the following
      list lists a few issues which should help with that.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        all levels must have a fixed height of 15 tiles, Milestone1
        will not have vertical scrolling and will run at 640x480, thus
        this limitation
      </li>

      <li>
        all normal levels should have a length of around 500 tiles with one
        reset point in the middle
      </li>

      <li>
        there will be bonus levels/rooms which should either be one
        screen large (20x15) or multiple screens (60x15), they should
        be much smaller than normal levels</li>

      <li>
        levels must not mix different tiles sets, a level should
        focus on one tileset and use this consistently, having a
        translation at the end of the level to the next one is ok,
        but there shouldn't be an overlap in the levels itself
      </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      Also make sure that the transitions from one tile to another are
      right and look good, so use the right tiles in the right places
      and don't simply add block on block:

    <subsection title="State">
      Currently we have 15 levels none of these are final and will for
      sure need additional fixup, better enemy placement, etc. But it
      should be a good start. More levels are very welcome.
