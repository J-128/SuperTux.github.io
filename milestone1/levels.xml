      This should be a guideline for level designers. You can of
      course do whatever you want in your level design, but to get a
      consistent look&amp;feel it might be necessary to follow some
      styleguides, else your levels might get excluded from the
      release and just be released as random 'contrib' levels or
      whatever.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>all levels must have a fixed height of 15 tiles,
        Milestone1 will not have vertical scrolling</li>
      
      <li>all levels should have a length of around 500 tiles with
        one reset point in the middle
      </li>

      <li>there will be bonus levels/rooms
        which should either be one screen large (20x15) or multiple
        screens, they three or four</li>

      <li>levels must not mix different tiles sets, a level should
        focus on one tileset and use this consistently, having a
        translation at the end of the level to the next one is ok,
        but there shouldn't be an overlap in the levels itself</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Also make sure that the transitions from one tile to another
      are right and look good:
