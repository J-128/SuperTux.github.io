      <p>
        The font has to be of a fixed-width and height for all
        letters, ie. the size of the letters can be anything, but has
        to be constant for all letters of a given font. The current
        font is (based on the old one, just 'gaussion blur (iir) 2',
        'threshold 112', 'border 2'). It would be ideal to have a more
        handwriting-like look of the font, but since that can be quite
        a bit of work to create and since the current one doesn't look
        all that bad a better font isn't a requirement, but would
        still be nice to have.
