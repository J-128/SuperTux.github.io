    <p>
      SuperTux is a classic 2D jump'n run sidescroller game in a
      style similar to the original SuperMario games. The
      <em>Milestone1</em> release of SuperTux features 9 enemies, 26 playable
      levels, software and OpenGL rendering modes, configurable
      joystick and keyboard input, new music and completely redone
      graphics. Together with a little story, we hope to provide a good
      gaming experience with this first Milestone release.
