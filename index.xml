		<p>
			SuperTux is a classic 2D jump'n run sidescroller game in a
			style similar to the original SuperMario games. The
			<em>Milestone1</em> release of SuperTux features 9 enemies, 26 playable
			levels, software and OpenGL rendering modes, configurable
			joystick and keyboard input, new music and completely redone
			graphics. Together with a little story, we hope to provide a good
			gaming experience with this first Milestone release.

		<p>
			The improvements in Milestone1 are in huge part the result of the
			work done surrounding the <a

			of the Month March 2004</a> event on <a
